= About =

The Eurgle/FlySky/Imax/Turnigy 9x r/c Transmitter is a nicely built unit basically copied from a more recognized manufacturer.

The unit itself hosts an Atmel AtMega64 8-bit MCU. The hardware includes 2 sticks, 3 potentiometers and 7 switches. It also supports a 128x64px screen without a back light.

This project aims to replace the software that comes with the standard transmitter with a more powerful and flexible version.

Some planned improvements are: Up to 16 Models in memory Up to 16 output channels Multi-level mixes Any function can be assigned to any output 5pt and 9pt curves

This project is based on he th9x project. http://code.google.com/p/th9x/
