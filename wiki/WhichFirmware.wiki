= Which firmware? =

You will by now have probably noticed that there are quite a few different versions of the firmware.  Each of these variations to the core firmware has been created to meet specific requirements by the projects developers.

Each firmware is named with a variety of suffexes to help you identify what the firmware does.  

The current list of suffixes is as follows:

 * NOHT  - do not show the heli & template menu's
 * SPKR  - used for hardware that has the speaker mod for variable tones
 * FRSKY - used if you have moddified your radio to receive frsky telemetry
 * JETI - used if you have modified your radio to receive jeti telemetry
 * NMEA - used if you have modified your radio to receive NMEA gps data
 * ARDUPILOT - used if you have modified your radio to receive ardupilot data

In the following example:

ER9x-FRSKY-NOHT

Would mean.  ER9X, with FRSKY support, No Heli & Template menu.

Your choice of firmware will very much depend on the mod's you have done to your radio.  Typically, most people start on just ER9X, then over time would move on to other options as they make changes to there gear!
