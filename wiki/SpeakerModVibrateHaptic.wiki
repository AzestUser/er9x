= Speaker Mods with Haptic Feedback =

This circuit shows the way that the vibration motor can be wired up to the radio for use with the -HAPTIC range of firmware options.  This firmare version provides greater control of when the vibration motor is actually used!

Modifying the radio is dead simple. 

Note!  Once you perform this mod you will have to use the -speaker version of the er9x firmware!

You will need two parts on your shopping list:

1.  A piezo speaker.  (this speaker needs to no more than 2.5cm to 3cm diameter.) (a normal speaker will work, however tests have shown a piezo has a much lower power draw) 

2.  a capacitor. (4.7u) seems to do the trick.

3. a capacitor (10uf)

4.  a 4mm vibration motor to provide the haptic feedback.

shows how you need to modify your radio.  It should be largely self explanatory!

The lead to the 'free pin' has not yet been allocated.  This should be running in the next couple of weeks! (09/09/2011)
