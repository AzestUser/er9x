These lights are functional, and will deliver a basic light system.  However you should be warned of the following key points.

 * Power Usage is much higher than the EL backlight methods.
 * The er9x firmware will not be able to turn this light on or off without some modification to the led board and an install of a switching system - this will require some soldering.
