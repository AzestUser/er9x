These lights are functional, and will deliver a basic light system.  However you should be warned of the following key points.

 * Power Usage is much higher than the EL backlight methods.
 * The er9x firmware will not be able to turn this light on or off without some <a href="http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=18732545&postcount=7855">modification to the led board and an install of a switching system</a> - this will require some soldering.
