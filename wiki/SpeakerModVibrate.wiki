= Speaker Mods with Haptic Feedback (basic) =

<b><i>Please note that this circuit diagram is effective - but soon to be replaced by an altertive circute that will use a spare bin on the radios cpu to turn the motor on and off. This feature will use a new version of the firmware with a -HAPTIC suffix</i></b>

The purpose of the speaker mod is to start paving the way for more usefull tones and beeps for use in telemetry versions of er9x. 

The firmware with the speaker mod enabled has a few 'nice' features such as low/mid/high point trim tones and different tones on the left right button, however the real long term benifit will be in the long term use of the tones over the telemetry channel. The different tones will make the warnings far more identifiable to the operator!

This mod is not more complicated than the regualar speaker mod, but enables you to get a 'vibrating' alert when the beep plays for long time.  This can be really usefull when flying on noisy sites!

Modifying the radio is dead simple. 

Note!  Once you perform this mod you will have to use the -speaker version of the er9x firmware!

You will need two parts on your shopping list:

1.  A piezo speaker.  (this speaker needs to no more than 2.5cm to 3cm diameter.) (a normal speaker will work, however tests have shown a piezo has a much lower power draw) 

2.  a capacitor. (4.7u) seems to do the trick.

3.  a 4mm vibration motor to provide the haptic feedback.

shows how you need to modify your radio.  It should be largely self explanatory!
