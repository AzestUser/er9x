= Using er9x =

Currently the best first step you can take in using er9x is to read the manual!

This can be download as a PDF file from:

<a href="http://er9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/ER9x%20Users%20Guide.pdf">http://er9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/ER9x%20Users%20Guide.pdf</a>

The guide is being updated all the time, so do go back to it once and a while for a review.

Once you have got to grips with some of the basics, there are loads of people who are more than willing to help on the rggroups.com thread.  You can access this forum on:
