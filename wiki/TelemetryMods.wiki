= How to modify your 9x for frsky telemetry =

The following guides have been created by different members of the community to explain how they approached the mods.  

A good suggestion would be to read all of them!  Then decide which method you would like to follow.  As a general rule they all follow much the same formular, just with different hardware configurations.
