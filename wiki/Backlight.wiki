= Installing an LCD backlight =

The stock radio does not include a back light, meaning that in low light conditions, the display can be difficult to read.  The mods below provide simple solutions to solve this problem!

* Smartie Parts Board & Backlight
* DIY EL board driver
* Cheap LED Driver

If you are new to this radio, and not too good with your electronics; then the smartie parts board and programmer are the recommended way to achieve both a backlight and a programmer.
